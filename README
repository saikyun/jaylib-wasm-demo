0. ensure repository has been cloned recursively

1. build janet once to produce amalgamated janet.c and patched janet.h

   for *nixen, that's:

     cd janet
     make
     cd ..

2. build wasm version of libraylib.a

   for *nixen, that's something like:

     source ~/src/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh      # tested with emscripten 3.1.3
     cd jaylib/raylib/src
     make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_WEB -B
     # if the line above fails, try:
     make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_WEB -B -e
     cd ../../..

3. build wasm bits (public directory will get populated)

   for *nixen, that's:

     sh build-wasm.sh

4. start a web server to serve the built files:

   for a machine with python3, that might be:

     python3 -m http.server --drirectory public

5. try out the results:

   visit http://localhost:8000 and click on main.html
